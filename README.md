2. change directories to the repository you just cloned. this means typing "cd lineFollower" in your terminal.

3. make a branch for yourself so you don't mess up other people's code. make a new branch by typing in "git branch *YOUR NAME*". Only do this ONE time!!!! 

4. switch to that branch with "git checkout *YOURNAME*". do this EVERY time!!

3. type in "git pull" to make sure you have the current version. do this every time!!!

4. from here, make or edit the files you want to change with your desired text editor. i use vim so i type "vim *FILENAME.ino*" into my command line. then i edit the file. it doesn't matter what editor you use. save your edits.

5. back in the command line, type "git add *FILENAME.ino*".

6. then type "git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"".
